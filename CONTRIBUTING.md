# Contributions

If you wish to contribute, the steps are relatively simple.  Fork the repo into your own, make edits, make sure to merge the current version into your edits, then make a pull request with a comment fully detailing exactly what you modified and why.  If there is no comment or any edited files are not mentioned it will be denied.
